# My journey thus far

My interest in the field of Computer Science first sparked at a young age through my obsession with video games. I remember when my dad first got a Nokia phone I would always beg him to let me play some of the pre-installed games. It was one of those old Nokia phones that had a keypad. The next big development was when I first had access to a PC which was again through my dad. Luckily, I was allowed to use some of the computers in his office when they weren't being occupied. As technology continued to improve and computers started to take over the world, laptops started to become affordable. This resulted in my family buying a laptop and of course that led to me spending hours on it after school just gaming away. These experiences I had as a child kindled my love and appreciation for computers. I wanted to know everything about how they work. So when I was presented with the opportunity to choose Computer Science as one of my subjects for IGCSE, it was a no-brainer. As part of the course, our teacher made us use Visual Basic as the primary programming language. Then all it took was that first program to print "Hello World" in the terminal for me to fall in love with programming. This was the last bit of development that cemented my passion in this field and is what made me choose Computer Science as my degree of choice at university. I will soon be graduating and I'm hoping to kickstart my career in this wonderful field.
